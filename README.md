# Parkinsons-Disease-Detection-Using-ML-Algorithms
this Machine learning (ML) algorithms can be used to detect PD at an early stage, when it is more treatable. ML algorithms can be trained on data from patients with PD, such as their symptoms, medical history, and imaging scans. The algorithms can then be used to classify new patients as having PD or not having PD.
